In this report, titled "What Wins NBA Games?" we analyse the playstyles of NBA teams using panel data spanning 30 teams over 26 years. We analyse playstyles along 3 dimensions and create weakly exogenous variables to measure each:
1) 3-pointers v. 2-pointers
2) Teamwork v. Star-effects
3) Aggression v. Defence

Simultaneously, we also estimate the impact of a coach's overall experience, past wins, and familiarity with the team on the number of wins for a team each season. Finally, we estimate the impact individual coaches have had for their teams over their career using coach fixed effects and show that coaches account for approximately 25% of variation in a team's wins.
